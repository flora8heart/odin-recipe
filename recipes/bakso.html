    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bakso (pronounced 'bahk-soh' with an almost silent 'k') means meatball in
      Indonesian. You'll sometimes see it written as baso.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it's not being served from a street stall or at a food market, it'll be
      dished up from street carts towed around by bike or motorbike. It's
      usually served up as a meatball soup (sup bakso), and sometimes with
      noodles, tofu and/or wilted greens (mie / mee bakso).
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the type of meatballs used, it might be called bakso ayam
      (chicken meatballs), bakso sapi (beef meatballs) or bakso babi (pork
      meatballs).

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    For the meatballs
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the beef, garlic, fried shallot, baking powder, beef stock powder
        and egg into a large mixing bowl. Mix well to combine with your hands.
        Next, add half the cornstarch and mix through, then half the ice water
        and mix again. Repeat with the remaining half of the cornstarch and ice
        water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using gloves, make the meatballs by squeezing the mixture a few times
        between your thumb and forefinger until smooth. The meatball should be
        the size of a ping pong ball. Scoop off with a teaspoon and place into a
        large pot of hot water. Note: Watch
        <a href="https://youtu.be/bqNLNGW2XuA">video</a> for the technique.
        Alternatively, take tablespoon of mixture, and roll between your palms
        into a meatball shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pop the pot onto the stove over high heat and bring to the boil. Make
        sure the meatballs don't stick to the bottom. They'll float once they're
        cooked through (around 15-20 minutes).
      </li>
    </ol>

    For the soup:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pop your garlic, ginger, chopped celery, crushed lemongrass, sugar,
        spring onion and beef stock into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.
        Continue to cook for 5 minutes before switching off the heat. Garnish
        with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
    </ol>

    To Serve:
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, place 4-5 meatballs and any accompaniments you'd like
        (bok choy, noodles, tofu etc) before pouring 2-3 ladles over the top.
        Add your favourite sauces such as sambal and kecap manis, and enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>

    Recipe Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rolling Meatballs - If you find the traditional method for making
        meatballs difficult, just roll them in your palms instead.

      <li>
        Smoothest Texture - To get the super smooth texture of traditional bakso
        meatballs, you ideally need to use a food processor. If you don't have
        one, you can still enjoy this dish with meatballs mixed by hand, so
        don't let that stop you!
      </li>
      <li>
        Lumpy Meatballs - If the surface of your meatballs is lumpy after
        cooking, you can smooth them out by rolling them between your palms once
        they've cooled down enough.
