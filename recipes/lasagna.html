    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
      <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn off the heat; drain and discard grease. </li>
      <li>Stir spaghetti sauce into the skillet. Pour water into the empty sauce jar; cover, shake well, then pour liquid into the skillet. Stir until beef and sauce are well combined. </li>
      <li>Mix ricotta cheese, 1 1/4 cups mozzarella, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg together in a bowl until well blended. </li>
      <li>Spread 1 cup meat sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, and 1 cup meat sauce. Repeat layers twice more with noodles, ricotta mixture, and meat sauce. Top with remaining noodles and meat sauce, then sprinkle remaining mozzarella and Parmesan over top. </li>
      <li>Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray. Place the sheet, sprayed-side down, over the baking dish and seal tightly. </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until heated through, about 15 more minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
